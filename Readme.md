## Portfolio and personal journey

This a journey through my personal and professional life so far. It showcases the work I have done as a print studio artist and graphic designer from 1984 to the present. I chronicle some personal triumphs and tradgies I have experienced along the way as I was doing the work. You will also see my transition from print to web design.
